# Object Oriented JavaScript Lesson 1 - Introduction

This repository contains the code for the lesson 1 introduction to Object Oriented JavaScript. In this lesson, we explore the fundamental concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript.

## Overview

The lesson covers the following topics:

1. Introduction to Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
2. Basic concepts of encapsulation
3. Implementation of encapsulation in JavaScript

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The HTML file that serves as the entry point to the lesson. It contains a simple HTML structure with a heading.
- **objects.js**: The JavaScript file that demonstrates the concept of encapsulation by defining an object `userOne` with properties and methods.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this lesson, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. This will execute the JavaScript code contained in `objects.js`, demonstrating the concept of encapsulation in Object Oriented JavaScript.
