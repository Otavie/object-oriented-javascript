# Object Oriented JavaScript Lesson 4

This branch, `lesson-4-classes-constructors`, contains code related to Lesson 4 of the Object Oriented JavaScript tutorial series. In this lesson, we explore classes and constructors in JavaScript.

## Files Included

1. **index.html**: This HTML file serves as the entry point for the lesson. It includes a simple HTML structure with a `<h1>` heading and a reference to the `objects.js` file.

2. **objects.js**: This JavaScript file contains code demonstrating the use of classes and constructors in JavaScript. It defines a `User` class with a constructor that initializes `email` and `name` properties. Two instances of the `User` class (`userOne` and `userTwo`) are created with different email and name values.

## Usage

To view the lesson, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. This will execute the JavaScript code contained in `objects.js` and display any output or behavior defined within the script.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Classes**: Introduction to classes in JavaScript.
- **Constructors**: Understanding constructor functions and their role in initializing class instances.
- **Object Creation**: Using the `new` keyword to create instances of classes.
