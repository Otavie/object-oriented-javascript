# Object Oriented JavaScript

This GitHub repository contains a series of lessons on Object-Oriented JavaScript programming. Each branch in this repository represents a different lesson, covering various concepts and techniques related to object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript.

## Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile programming language widely used for both client-side and server-side development. Object-oriented programming is a paradigm that enables developers to organize code into reusable objects with properties and methods.

In this series of lessons, we explore the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in JavaScript, including:

- Creating objects and classes
- Defining properties and methods
- Inheritance and prototype chains
- Encapsulation and information hiding
- Polymorphism and method overriding
