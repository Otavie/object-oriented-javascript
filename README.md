# Object Oriented JavaScript Lesson 5

This branch, `lesson-5-class-method`, demonstrates the usage of class methods in Object Oriented JavaScript. The code files included in this branch are:

## Files:
- **index.html**: This HTML file serves as the entry point for the lesson. It contains a simple structure with a heading displaying the lesson title.

- **objects.js**: This JavaScript file contains the implementation of a `User` class with class methods `login()` and `logout()`. It also creates instances of the `User` class and demonstrates the usage of these methods.

## Usage:
To run the code in this lesson, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The browser will execute the JavaScript code included in the `objects.js` file, which demonstrates the functionality of class methods in JavaScript classes.

## Description:
The `User` class represents a user object with properties `email` and `name`. It defines two class methods: `login()` and `logout()`, which log messages to the console indicating when a user logs in or logs out, respectively.

The `objects.js` file creates two instances of the `User` class (`userOne` and `userTwo`) with different email and name values. It then calls the `logout()` method on `userOne` and the `login()` method on `userTwo`, demonstrating the usage of class methods in JavaScript classes.

This lesson serves as an introduction to class methods and their usage within JavaScript classes, providing a foundation for building more complex object-oriented JavaScript applications.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different modifications to deepen your understanding of JavaScript's object-oriented programming concepts.
