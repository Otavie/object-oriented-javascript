# Object Oriented JavaScript Lesson 3

This repository contains the code for the "Object Oriented JavaScript Lesson 3" tutorial. In this lesson, we explore classes in JavaScript.

## Files

- **index.html**: HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- **objects.js**: JavaScript file containing the code for defining a class.

## Usage

To run the code, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. This will display the webpage and execute the JavaScript code in the `objects.js` file.

## Description

In this lesson, we introduced classes in JavaScript. A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects with similar properties and methods. In the `objects.js` file, we define a basic class named `User`. However, as of this lesson, the class does not contain any properties or methods. Classes are fundamental in object-oriented programming and allow for the creation of more complex and structured applications.
